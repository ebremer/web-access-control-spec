# Web Access Control (WAC)

Web Access Control (WAC) is a decentralized cross-domain access control system
providing a way for Linked Data systems to set authorization conditions on
HTTP resources using the Access Control List (ACL) model.

WAC (as used by the [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/)) is based on
Tim Berners-Lee's May 2009 proposal, as originally captured, and subsequently
evolved by the community,
at [Web Access Control Wiki](https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl).
This spec is a particular subset of the options and extensions described in
the wiki, as well as implementation experience.

Implementations are strongly encouraged to use existing approaches that
provide an extension of the rules of Linked Data, eg.
[Solid Protocol](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol),
[LDP](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/).
